# Intro
README.md for Shtory - a bash adventure game.
This file contains the rules for the game and how to play.

# Starting
## BETA
To start, simply go to the directory that shtory is stored in and type "chmod +x shtory" to make it executable.
Then, type "./shtory" to begin. The document will lead you to the following levels. 

# BUGS
- As of now, your in-game progress resets every time your system reboots. 

# FIXES
- We are planning to add files to store progress.

# Additional notes
- We haven't added the "shtory" executable file yet (mentioned in the [Starting] https://github.com/HabibKhan1/Shtory/blob/main/README.md#starting section). 
- Please note that this is all BETA!
